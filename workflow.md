You can persist data in IBM Cloud Container Service to share data between app instances and to protect your data from being lost if a component in your Kubernetes cluster fails. For having a high availability of storage in the IBM cloud container service we have several options available.
* Non-persistent data storage options
* Persistent data storage options for high availability
    * [Pesistent Volume](#persistent-volume)
    * [Persistent Volume Claim](#persistent-volume-claim)
    * [Create a pod with persistent Volume](#create-a-pod-with-persistent-volume)
